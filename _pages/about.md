# üéì About Me
Hello! I am a doctoral student specializing in public finance, with primary research interests in demography, labor economics, education policy, and education finance. I enjoy coding and creating data visualizations, and I am passionate about sharing my journey of self development, my academic discoveries and insights. My personal website is a platform where I document my growth, showcase data exploration projects, and discuss findings in my areas of research.

**Research Interests**: Educational Economics, Digital Economy and Big Data, Public Policy and Technological Innovation, Population Economics, Labor Economics


# üìù Publication and Working Paper 
- **Liu, S.** (2020). Educational Authority and Expenditure Responsibility Division: Conceptual Definition, Division Principles and Solutions. *Educational Economic Review*, 5(02), 117-128. 

- **From Food to Future: Household Resource Reallocation under a School Feeding Program in Rural China** (with Cheng Yuan, Zitong Wang, under review)
  - **Research Topic**: Causal effects of school lunch programs on dynamic household expenditure reallocation
  - **Methodology**: Based on CFPS data, using DID and event study approaches
  - **Key Findings**: The program reduced beneficiary households' food expenditure by 14.5% and increased educational investment by 23.1%, primarily driven by autonomous educational spending. Effects were more pronounced for low-income families, those with less educated parents, and left-behind children. A household human capital investment model reveals that nutrition improvement programs can alleviate educational inequality by easing credit constraints and raising educational expectations.

- **Last-Mile Logistics and Rural Labor Supply: Evidence from China** (with Cheng Yuan, Lauren Johnston, working paper)
  - **Research Topic**: Impact of rural logistics infrastructure (outlet density/shortest distance) on rural labor supply
  - **Methodology**: Based on national logistics outlet POI data and 2013-2019 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), employing individual fixed effects models and instrumental variable approach using historical post office distribution
  - **Key Findings**: The effect shows a "U-shaped" distribution: for elderly (60+), proximity to nearest facilities significantly reduces labor dependency on health status and increases agricultural labor participation; for young adults, logistics development promotes e-commerce adoption and income growth while reducing out-migration. These changes improve household consumption and intergenerational economic support, indicating that "last-mile" infrastructure plays a key role in promoting inclusive digital development in aging rural economies.

- **Digital Divide in Educational Informatization Public Investment: Local Preference, Regional Differentiation and Digital Matthew Effect** (Doctoral Dissertation Working Paper)
  - **Research Topic**: Based on government procurement, patent and fiscal transfer payment data, using Bartik instrumental variable to identify the impact of digital economy activity on educational informatization investment and regional gaps, and analyze the moderating role of central fiscal intervention
  - **Methodology**: Empirical analysis using government procurement data, patent data, and fiscal transfer payment data with Bartik instrumental variable approach
  - **Key Findings**: First, regional digital technology innovation activity has a significant and robust promoting effect on educational informatization investment (especially in basic education), providing empirical support for the "digital Matthew effect". Second, there exists complex "local preference" in educational informatization procurement: regions with underdeveloped digital economy show stronger local procurement tendencies, constituting a potential micro-mechanism for exacerbating regional gaps. Third, central "thin reform" special transfer payments for basic education informatization mainly drive hardware and network infrastructure, and this policy effectively alleviates the "digital Matthew effect" to some extent. This study reveals the complex interaction between regional innovation capacity, local procurement behavior, and central fiscal intervention in shaping educational digital equity patterns, providing important empirical insights for formulating more precise educational resource allocation and regional balanced development policies.
